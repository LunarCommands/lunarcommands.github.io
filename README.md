# Personal Portfolio Website with Blog

This project is a personal portfolio website with an integrated blog feature. It showcases my projects, skills, and experiences, allowing visitors to learn more about me and my work.

## Technologies Used

The website is built using the following technologies:

- [Astro](https://astro.build/): A static site generator that enables faster website development by leveraging modern web development tools.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): A utility-first CSS framework that facilitates rapid UI design and development.
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/): A revolutionary JavaScript framework that simplifies web development by compiling components into highly efficient and lightweight JavaScript code.

## Features

1. **Homepage:** The homepage provides an overview of my portfolio and introduces visitors to my work. It includes sections highlighting my skills, projects, and a brief bio.

2. **Blog:** The website includes a dedicated blog section where I regularly share articles, tutorials, and insights. Visitors can browse through the latest blog posts and access individual posts to read more.
