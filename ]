            <p class="text-gray-800">
              I have learned a lot in the past 4 years in high school. From C++, PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ending
              with Python. I fell in love with Django once and we are still meeting sometimes. I love programming and
              learning new stuff all the time. I am currently learning Go.

            <p class="text-gray-800">
              It is linked to programming, but I want to give a much closer look at what I am truly doing. I've chosen
              Python as my main language because of its beauty. I pay a lot of attention to code to look as beautiful as it
              can. Automation is the thing that Python handles very well when it comes to finding a quick solution to a
              problem that just appeared. Once I had a problem to download all of my favorite music from my YouTube
              playlist, so I wrote a few lines of code, and it worked. You can find all my projects on my GitHub account.

            <p class="text-gray-800">
              The fact that I like to solve problems should not surprise anyone anymore. Since I was a little kid I loved
              everything related to hacking. Someday I came across the site with CTF's and it got me hooked to this day.
              From CTF's, by hacking my way in to the hackthebox site, ending with pentesting. All legal of course ðŸ˜‰.

            <p class="text-gray-800">
              Since I was a little kid I've always loved electronic music. Well, I think I love everything related to
              computers ðŸ˜œ. I started my music journey listening to the very famous group - The Prodigy whose still big
              inspiration for me. I got through many electronic genres from Drum and Bass to Techno. The part of me that is
              responsible for creativity has spoken and I have started making music. It is inseparable part of me which I
              satisfy in my free time.

            <p class="text-gray-800">
              My father got two turntables and a lot of vinyl records, so I have decided to try myself in DJing. After a
              couple of weeks I was invited by my friends to a party in a club. They wanted me to play warmup. I borrowed
              some techno vinyls from my father's collection and came to the club as Phil Elementz. Since then I am building
              successively my career as a Dj. I record podcasts, vinyl sets and play in clubs.

            <p class="text-gray-800">
              I played basketball for the team from my city for 4 years. I had to quit because of my knee injury. I wanted to
              go back to my favorite sport as quick as possible, but when it happened I was already too old for playing in
              my city's team. To this day I am playing with my friends on the courts or rented halls and watching my favorite
              team (Dallas Mavericks) playing, and I am sure that I will never quit.
