# My First Blog Post

Welcome to my _new blog_! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post. I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts
