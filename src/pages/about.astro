							I have learned a lot in the past 4 years in high school. From C++, PHP, HTML, CSS, and
							JavaScript, ending with Python. I fell in love with Django once and we are still
							meeting sometimes. I love programming and learning new stuff all the time. I am
							currently learning Go.

						<h2 class="mb-2 text-2xl font-semibold">Automation</h2>
						<p class="text-gray-800">
							It is linked to programming, but I want to give a much closer look at what I am truly
							doing. I've chosen Python as my main language because of its beauty. I pay a lot of
							attention to code to look as beautiful as it can. Automation is the thing that Python
							handles very well when it comes to finding a quick solution to a problem that just
							appeared. Once I had a problem to download all of my favorite music from my YouTube
							playlist, so I wrote a few lines of code, and it worked. You can find all my projects
							on my GitHub account.

						<p class="text-gray-800">
							The fact that I like to solve problems should not surprise anyone anymore. Since I was
							a little kid I loved everything related to hacking. Someday I came across the site
							with CTF's and it got me hooked to this day. From CTF's, by hacking my way in to the
							hackthebox site, ending with pentesting. All legal of course ðŸ˜‰.

						<p class="text-gray-800">
							Since I was a little kid I've always loved electronic music. Well, I think I love
							everything related to computers ðŸ˜œ. I started my music journey listening to the very
							famous group - The Prodigy whose still big inspiration for me. I got through many
							electronic genres from Drum and Bass to Techno. The part of me that is responsible for
							creativity has spoken and I have started making music. It is inseparable part of me
							which I satisfy in my free time.

						<p class="text-gray-800">
							My father got two turntables and a lot of vinyl records, so I have decided to try
							myself in DJing. After a couple of weeks I was invited by my friends to a party in a
							club. They wanted me to play warmup. I borrowed some techno vinyls from my father's
							collection and came to the club as Phil Elementz. Since then I am building
							successively my career as a Dj. I record podcasts, vinyl sets and play in clubs.

						<p class="text-gray-800">
							I played basketball for the team from my city for 4 years. I had to quit because of my
							knee injury. I wanted to go back to my favorite sport as quick as possible, but when
							it happened I was already too old for playing in my city's team. To this day I am
							playing with my friends on the courts or rented halls and watching my favorite team
							(Dallas Mavericks) playing, and I am sure that I will never quit.
